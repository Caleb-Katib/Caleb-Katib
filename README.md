My name is Khaled Alkhatib and I am a web developer. I was born in Syria, raised in Saudi Arabia and currently living in Canada.
I started as a dentist then decided to follow something I truly desire. I am currently in the process of learning and diving into the world of web development. You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaledalkhatib/).
